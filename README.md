# 🎯 M416Mind

**Train an AI agent to play like a professional PUBG Mobile player** by learning from real pro gameplay data using **Imitation Learning (IL)** + **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, and deploy it in a safe sandbox environment to test and refine its skills.

---

## 📌 Project Goal
- Learn human-like gameplay from professional PUBG players.
- Use Imitation Learning for initial skill acquisition.
- Fine-tune with Reinforcement Learning for optimization.
- Deploy in a sandbox to avoid violating PUBG’s Terms of Service.

## 🛠 Core Components
1. **Data Capture System**
   - Record game frames (OBS Studio, in-engine capture).
   - Log player actions (movement, aim, shooting, crouching, item use).
   - Capture game state (sandbox mode only).
   - Sync all with timestamps.

2. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Extract and downsample frames (~10 FPS).
   - Pair with action logs.
   - Split into train/val/test sets.
   - Apply augmentations (brightness, motion blur, FOV variation).

3. **Model Architecture**
   - **Vision Encoder:** ResNet/EfficientNet.
   - **Temporal Model:** LSTM / Transformer.
   - **Action Head:** Predict movement, aim, and actions.
   - RL fine-tuning with PPO/SAC.

4. **Training Pipeline**
   - Stage 1: Behavior Cloning (Imitation Learning).
   - Stage 2: RL Fine-Tuning in sandbox.
   - Stage 3: Human-like behavior injection.

5. **Evaluation**
   - Aim accuracy
   - Survival time
   - K/D ratio
   - Reaction time
   - Human-likeness score

6. **Deployment**
   - Sandbox matches against scripted AI.
   - Optional “AI Coach Mode” for player feedback.

## ✅ Ethical Note
This project **must only be used** in:
- Custom rooms
- Private servers
- Sandbox maps

Using this bot on live PUBG servers violates their **Terms of Service** and can result in account bans.

If you want, I can **also include a project diagram** in the README to make it visually engaging when people open your GitHub repo. That will make it look much more professional.
